# Notifications: Generate from templates
To create notification content, you can use the `template` generator if supported for the 3PID medium which will read
content from configured files.

Placeholders can be integrated into the templates to dynamically populate such content with relevant information like
the 3PID that was requested, the domain of your Identity server, etc.

Templates can be configured for each event that would send a notification to the end user. Events share a set of common
placeholders and also have their own individual set of placeholders.

## Configuration
To configure paths to the various templates:
```yaml
threepid.medium.<YOUR 3PID MEDIUM HERE>:
  generators:
    template:
      invite: '/path/to/invite-template.eml'
      session:
        validation:
          local: '/path/to/validate-local-template.eml'
          remote: 'path/to/validate-remote-template.eml'
```
The `template` generator is usually the default, so no further configuration is needed.

### Local validation of 3PID Session
This template is used when to user which added their 3PID address to their profile/settings and the session policy
allows at least local sessions.  

#### Placeholders
| Placeholder          | Purpose                                                                              |

### Remote validation of 3PID Session
This template is used when to user which added their 3PID address to their profile/settings and the session policy only
allows remote sessions.

**NOTE:** 3PID session always require local validation of a token, even if a remote session is enforced.  
One cannot bind a Matrix ID to the session until both local and remote sessions have been validated.
