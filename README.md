# Overview
mxisd is a Federated Matrix Identity server for self-hosted Matrix infrastructures with [enhanced features](#features).
As an enhanced Identity service, it implements the [Matrix Identity service API](https://kamax.io/matrix/api/identity_service/unstable.html)
and several [extra features](#features) that greatly enhance user experience within Matrix.
It is the one stop shop for anything regarding Authentication, Directory and Identity management in Matrix built in a
single coherent product.
  
mxisd is specifically designed to connect to an existing on-premise Identity store (AD/Samba/LDAP, SQL Database,
Web services/app, etc.) and ease the integration of a Matrix infrastructure within an existing one.

The core principle of mxisd is to map between Matrix IDs and 3PIDs (Third-Party IDentifiers) for the Homeserver and its
users. 3PIDs can be anything that uniquely and globally identify a user, like:
- Email address
- Phone number
- Skype/Live ID
- Twitter handle
- Facebook ID

If you are unfamiliar with the Identity vocabulary and concepts in Matrix, **please read this [introduction](docs/concepts.md)**.

# Features
[Identity](docs/features/identity.md): As a [regular Matrix Identity service](https://kamax.io/matrix/api/identity_service/unstable.html#general-principles):
- Search for people by 3PID using its own Identity stores
  ([Spec](https://kamax.io/matrix/api/identity_service/unstable.html#association-lookup))
- Invite people to rooms by 3PID using its own Identity stores, with notifications to the invitee (Email, SMS, etc.)
  ([Spec](https://kamax.io/matrix/api/identity_service/unstable.html#post-matrix-identity-api-v1-store-invite))
- Allow users to add 3PIDs to their settings/profile
  ([Spec](https://kamax.io/matrix/api/identity_service/unstable.html#establishing-associations))
- Register accounts on your Homeserver with 3PIDs
  ([Spec](https://kamax.io/matrix/api/identity_service/unstable.html#establishing-associations))

As an enhanced Identity service:
- [Federation](docs/features/federation.md): Use a recursive lookup mechanism when searching and inviting people by 3PID,
  allowing to fetch data from:
  - Own Identity store(s)
  - Federated Identity servers, if applicable to the 3PID
  - Arbitrary Identity servers
  - Central Matrix Identity servers
- [Session Control](docs/threepids/session/session.md): Extensive control of where 3PIDs are transmitted so they are not
  leaked publicly by users
- [Authentication](docs/features/authentication.md): Use your Identity stores to perform authentication in [synapse](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse)
  via the [REST auth module](https://github.com/kamax-io/matrix-synapse-rest-auth)
- [Directory search](docs/features/directory.md) which allows you to search for users within your organisation,
  even without prior contact within Matrix using arbitrary search terms
- [Auto-fill of user profile](docs/features/authentication.md#profile-auto-fill) (Display name, 3PIDs)
- [Bridge Integration](docs/features/bridge-integration.md): Automatically bridge users without a published Matrix ID

# Use cases
- Use your existing Identity stores, do not duplicate your users information
- Auto-fill user profiles with relevant information
- As an organisation, stay in control of your data so it is not published to other servers by default where they
  currently **cannot be removed**
- Users can directly find each other using whatever attribute is relevant within your Identity store
- Federate your Identity server so you can discover others and/or others can discover you
